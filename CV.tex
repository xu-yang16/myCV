\begin{rSection}{Research Experience}
{\textbf{Design of Attack Strategy Based on Self-learning}} \hfill December 2018 $\sim$ NaN\\
Mentor: Yilin Mo, Associate Professor in Department of Automation, Tsinghua University\\
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Foucus on looking for an attack strategy to destabilise a system knowing as less model knowledge as possible.\\
		\item Currently use iterative learning control to estimate the Jacobian matrix between the output (measurements) and the input (control signals).\\
		\item The goal is to destabilise a system without triggering an alarm.
